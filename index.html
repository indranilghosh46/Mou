<p class="p1">You also know how much I love you ‚Äî it‚Äôs not something I can hide or fake.
I just need your love, your assurance, your presence.
That‚Äôs what keeps me grounded and helps me fight my insecurities.I want to keep growing with you, not apart from you.
I want to make you proud to have me, not disappointed.
And I promise, I‚Äôll never give you a reason to doubt my loyalty again. Jani ekhon rege achis ba kharap lagche. kintu bisas kor amar intension onno kichu chilo na. ami toke chara ar kauke vabtei pari na.‚ù§Ô∏è

<div class="paper red">
<p class="p1">I won‚Äôt defend myself with excuses because you deserve honesty, not explanations.
The truth is, I acted stupidly after our fight.
Not because I didn‚Äôt value you, but because I didn‚Äôt know how to handle my emotions right. But trust me, there was nothing more behind them. And I promise you I will never do the same thing which will hurt you.‚ù§Ô∏è</p>

<div class="paper">
  <p class="p1">I admit that I wasn‚Äôt always a very good guy.
I‚Äôve been a mixture of good and bad ‚Äî confused, impulsive, and sometimes careless.
But the moment you came into my life, everything started to change.
You made me realize what real love, honesty, and commitment mean.
You brought light into my messy world, and for the first time, I actually wanted to be a better man. <span style="color: red !important;">‚ù§Ô∏è</span></p>

  <p class="p1">Mou,
I don‚Äôt even know where to begin, but I want to start with one thing straight from my heart ‚Äî I‚Äôm sorry.
I know I hurt you, and I can‚Äôt even express how bad I feel.
You mean the world to me, and seeing you upset because of my actions feels like a punishment I truly deserve. <span style="color: red !important;">‚ù§Ô∏è</span></p>
